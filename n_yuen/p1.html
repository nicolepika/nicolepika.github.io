		<p>
		 This is the first sketch I have done in Processing, to understand the program I attempted to create different shapes such as ellipse(), line(), rect(). At first, it was hard but as I played around with the code I gradually found how to color the shapes, give it an outline, resize them and place them in different spots in the sketch. I didn't know what I was doing so after doing sketch 3-6 I went back and I understand it now.

		<p>
	This was extremely hard because I never did anything like this. I found out there was a static mode and you can't mix it with active mode. It took me a while to learn the difference between the two but I got it at the end. I used the background from sketch 1 and merged it with the circles flickering. It took a while to fully understand how to alter the lines or even how to change the shape of the circle to turn into a rectangle. But I found out that some have void setup and that's static mode and ones without it are active mode so you have to have it in order for it to work.

		<p>
    For this sketch, we learned the "toggle logic with if statements". So if you click on the "Click me!" you can play around with the toggle I created. You simply click letter 'b' on your keyboard to see the image and color shift. I included a mouse event where the image will follow your mouse movement. I did the toggle wrong at first but I got it to be an image instead. The head and the butt were made with AI and Photoshop.

         <h4> Sketch4</h4>
		<p>
   Sketch 4 four was extremely hard because It's my first added text in this program. I added custom functions with argumentive statements called nicoleBlock() and nicoleCircle(). What the custom functions did was make the shapes in the sketch grow bigger, changing the size and location of the shapes. After that, I added the text on the bottom and that went smoothly. As I struggled with this assignment I thought it would be funny if I added a text "this is so hard I cried so much" and set it as my mouseX and mouseY so when you drag your mouse on top of the sketch you would have a hard time to reading it to portray my struggles.

         <h4> Sketch5</h4>
		<p>
    For sketch 5 I used arrays to have the Pikachus float everywhere. I loaded the images into processing and had a sky image as the background. Then I found out the if statements helped arrange the boundary for the Pikachu to float around. I also made the sizes different on the Pikachus so as they float close to the screen they are bigger giving it a good depth in field.  It was definitely challenging to figure out how to make an image as an array but my wonderful classmates helped me out and now I have Pikachu floating around! If I were to continue on this, I would want to have a dart on the mousePressed so if you move your mouse onto the balloons they'll pop and the Pikachus will fall.

		<p>
	For this sketch it is still in progress. I want to change it into photos of pikachus however I still have not found a way to do so. Therefore I will continue trying until I find how to. But as as for now I have a penguin monster waving his arms around. This was wasn't as complicated as other sketches but adding the image is quite the struggle. But i won't give up! My page has to be full of pikachus!!

         <h4> Sketch7</h4>
		<p>
		For this sketch, I combined spring and 3d wave together to get a sailing effect. If you click on the boat you can fling him around across the sea. Pikachu was created in AI and photoshop then added into processing. This is only a test to see what my project 1 will look like and it looks a little too simple. It took me a really long time to figure out how to change the spring into an image because in the example provided it was only a circle that sprung around. Now it works however, it's not exactly working as I intended. The Pikachu only goes straight he doesn't go up. I will soon find the solution and I'll update it here!

         <h4> Project 1</h4>
		<p>
		For this sketch, I combined all 6 sketches into one. But the main combinations I used for this was the spring and 3d wave together. I was inspired to do something similar to sketch 7 where Pikachu is surfing. But as I ran into some errors it then became Pikachu in the snow! So Pikachu is a spring() if you click on him he would move and if you drag him he will sling back and forth. I created the Pikachu and his wooden board in AI and Photoshop then I dragged the png image into processing. The other requirement was to use a Millis commend and I used the Millis commend where the number of points increases as Pikachu obtains the snow particles. Lastly, The snow in the back is my custom function and they are called Nicole now(), their only purpose is to bounce around as if they were snow. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this assignment!
