<h6 class="blacktext"> Q1. Given the Wikipedia definitions on data and information, what is your own take on this and specifically what is the difference between data and information? </h6>  
       <div class="a">
        
  <P>  Data is a set of numbers that can be qualitative (categories?) or quantitative (numbers). As for information it is a story/ answers. They can be show with patterns that contain a message or some sort.

    <h6 class="blacktext"> Q2. From the Manovich reading, what is the difference between visualization and mapping?
 </h6>
     
     <div class="a">
        
  <p>
  Visualization is imaginative, so to me it is similar to brainstorming what possibilities there could be. While mapping is actually planning. For instance, If you’re drawing you can think of what to draw and you can think of whatever you want, the sky is your limit. Then when you map you draw out which ideas you chose from visualizing. In a way it is to refine your idea.
   </p>
   </div>


    
<h6 class="blacktext"> Q3. When Manovich states that visualization is the anti-sublime art what is he referring to? Do you agree with this notion?  </h6>
      
         <div class="a">
        
  <p>I didn’t get what he was saying in the passage. When he said anti sublime I thought he meant sublime text but that is obviously not what he’s talking about. In class we found out that anti sublime is anti perfect. Therefore when he mentioned the Romantic artists which has a reason to each part of the painting such as this foot is placed here to symbolize this etc where anti sublime is it isn’t mapped?  I disagree that with “data visualization art is concerned with the anti-sublime” because in a way they’re similar. Visualization is a process of blooming messy ideas where anti sublime is is anti perfect where all ideas aren’t perfect?
    </p>
</div>
       

   <h6 class="blacktext">Q4. When Manovich remarks on the 'dark-side' of mapping, what is he referring to?
What is this ability to map things there are no right answer

    </h6>
  
      <div class="a">
        
<p>  When he said ‘dark-side’ he’s referring to mapping and that it could be a better form. But with the power of mapping it is smarter than us because instead of calculating ourselves we just easily click a button for the computer to render for us.

   Q5. Group take home assignment: You will be assigned to a group, each person in the group is in charge of 1 artist. Watch the video and then write a paragraph summarizing the artist, on what they showed in their presentation, and the type of art they make. Elaborate on their specific interests in data and methods of visualization.

  <u>Laura Frick</u>
            </div>
<div class="a">
<p>A data artist that creates installations with the data she collects. People are often afraid of data being collected, however, Frick encourages people to collect as much as possible. When we think of data we think we know what we put out to the public. For instance, we know what we post on social media or what text we sent out etc. But, what we don’t know is a simple object like a Fitbit also collects data and the data obtained is information we probably don’t know about ourselves. From this, Frick expanded her idea into collecting all types of data she could but mainly specified with one and it was sleep data. She used a contraption from Zeo’s that measures your sleep and the headband strap measures your brainwave to identify your sleep state or if you’re awake. She wanted us to see that this of data is a hidden part of you that you don’t see and can learn from it. With the data, she collected she use the color code it with the rule system. Red would mean deep sleep, Yellow is rem sleep and white is trash sleep meaning you got no sleep. She then combined them into something similar looking to a cell membrane. Frick was then able to collect the sleep patterns from different people that used the device and compare them to each other. This then leads her to find out that sleep patterns are very specific to one person as if it were a set of fingerprints since everyone’s is different. In a way, it is a way to define “who you are”. With data tracking, you can discover parts of yourself you don’t know. Overall, her argument in the video is that data isn’t all about fitness or health, it is about who you are.</p>

  <u>Stefanie Posavec </u>

          <div class="a">
    <p> As an artist, Stefanie Posavec is a self-proclaimed “data illustrator.” Rather than data visualizer she feels “data illustrator” describes herself better, for contrary to typical data visualizers she does not know how to code html, java, nor javascript. Rather she maps out her data illustrations by hand: physically sketching or drawing in Photoshop. Other than lacking the knowledge to code, she finds her manual labor of data collection and construction attributes a greater emotional and personal quality to her artworks compared to artworks which were constructed by more convenient digital design tools. Also, her methods akin to her obsessive aesthetic. Her process of data collection is impressive, and asinine, which requires her to repeatedly review her subject(s) several times over till she discovers a trend her notice or is fond of. For example, her data-illustration on writing style, Writing Without Words, on one of her favorite books, On The Road, by Jack Kerouae. The data collection took her three weeks where she took meticulous notes and completely color-coated highlighted her copy of the novel. With the data, she illustrated a series of recursive algorithmic designs. One of the series was a tree-diagram which consist its center point to represent the book and continuous chain of numerous branching subdivisions of literary components: starting from book to chapters, paragraphs, sentences and words. Each number of branches represent the amount of components she found in corresponded category and its location marked by the connected previous category. The most interesting one of her series covers the differences between the six different editions of On The Road. The comparison of the six editions documents a color system which illustrates which words up to paragraph survived to the next, later edition (blue = survived, orange = was removed). This makes for interesting design because it’s both informative and similar to how biologist study the passing on of characteristic genes. Concerning On The Road, the illustrations may reveal the characteristics of Jack Kerouae’s writing style. There concept of new representation and informative discoveries generally describes Stefanie Posavec’s artwork. She is a non-coding “data-illustrator” who pursue new scientific mapping design of extensive data sets.

  <u>Nicholas Feltron </u>
         </div>
          <div class="a">
    <p> Nicholas Felton grew up being inspired by others telling stories and became a graphic designer to express those contents and share we others. This is when he discovered numbers could be a way of telling stories. With the elements of numbers and graphic design, the potential is infinite on where they go. The beauty of numbers of is the value behind them, making it easier to place them. Being a graphic designer, he can mold a dataset without affecting what the numbers mean. With Rhythm. Preparation vs execution he collected material and figure what to do with it, as long as it makes a pace. With the death of his father, the project was delayed a year into 2011 and then he moved forward. His desire to tell a story came from taking a series of postcards and collect them into one piece. Which then evolved into graphical pieces of the year that shows data and numbers of that year. 2005 annual report New year and Calendar. The piece is split into sections that specify what he did that year, like photographic subjects displaying a pie chart percentage of what he took photos of. Lots of using math as a mean of graphic design to tell a story. 
    <br>
    All data was captured in a natural way, but never in a structured way. Just a tedious manual process to clean it, but also need to categorize the data as well. After that, put everything into a spreadsheet to add metadata, but makes the storytelling much more compelling.To make queries and put it into processing he puts all the data into Mysql. An example would be that it would list the restaurants he went to dine in and pinpoint the location of it too, giving an image onto processing. Then made processing applications to sketch out the maps and to see the strengths of his restaurants he visited more frequently. Distribution is also another way to calculate how frequently he did something, for another representation of visual ways to present data. His queries list consisted a lot of varieties and factors that goes on in his day from the entire year. Afterwards, the final layout finalizing the piece where it is organized and connected in alphabetical and numerical order. After printed out and displayed, it is then uploaded to the web for online access.
